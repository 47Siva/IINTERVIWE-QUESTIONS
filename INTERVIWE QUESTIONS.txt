What is JIT?
     The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a critical component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 
designed to improve the performance of Java applications by dynamically converting Java bytecode 
into native machine code at runtime.

What about classLoader?
      A class loader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) responsible for 
dynamically loading classes into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at runtime.
Class loaders ensure that classes are loaded into memory only when needed, enabling features like 
dynamic loading, unloading, and secure execution of Java programs.

when is object create and allocate ?
   Objects are created and allocated at runtime, not compile time.
When you declare a reference variable, such as Person person;
no memory is allocated for the object itself, only for the reference.
Memory for the object is allocated when you use the new keyword to create an instance of a class.
